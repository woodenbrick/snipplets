h2. Snipplets

A dropdown menu to store snippets of data such as:
* code
* phone/ni/serial numbers
* passwords
* recipies
* anything the user wants to define

Items will be taggable and encyptable.

This is a very basic release 0.1 with many missing features, however the base creation and editing works correctly.
